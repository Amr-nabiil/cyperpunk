                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. The story takes place in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe. Players assume the first-person perspective of a customisable mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking and machinery with options for melee and ranged combat.

                    The game was developed using the REDengine 4 by a team of around 500 people, 
                    exceeding the number that worked on the studio's previous game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015).</p>
